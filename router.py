You are given an undirected connected graph. 
An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which, 
when removed along with associated edges, makes the graph disconnected
(or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph).
The task is to find all articulation points in the given graph.

Input:

n: an int representing the total number of nodes.
m: an integer representing the number of edges in the graph.
edges: the list of pair of integers - A, B representing an edge between the nodes A and B.

Algorithm:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph/
https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/cutpoints.html
Pick an arbitrary vertex of the graph root and run depth first search from it.
Note the following fact (which is easy to prove):

-Let's say we are in the DFS, looking through the edges starting from vertex vâ‰ root.
If the current edge (v,to) is such that none of the vertices to or its descendants
in the DFS traversal tree has a back-edge to any of ancestors of v,
then v is an articulation point. 
Otherwise, v is not an articulation point.

-Let's consider the remaining case of v=root.
This vertex will be the point of articulation
if and only if this vertex has more than one child in the DFS tree.
