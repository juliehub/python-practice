"""
Count the frequency of each word, then add it to heap that stores the best k candidates. 
Here, "best" is defined with our custom ordering relation, 
which puts the worst candidates at the top of the heap. 
At the end, we pop off the heap up to k times and reverse the result so that the best candidates are first.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(Nlogk), where NN is the length of words.
We count the frequency of each word in O(N) time, 
then we add NN words to the heap, each in O(logk) time. 
Finally, we pop from the heap up to kk times. 
As kâ‰¤N, this is O(Nlogk) in total.

In Python 3, we improve this to O(N+klogN). We use counter.most_common(k)
to return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least. 

Space Complexity: O(N), the space used to store our count.
