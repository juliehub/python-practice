# python-practice
This repository contains simple coding problems and solutions written in Python

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your favourite IDE

## How to run .py file
The most basic and the easy way to run Python scripts is by using the python command.
You need to open a command-line and type the word python followed by the path to your script file, like this:
```
python merging_ranges.py
```
It is useful to save the output in a different file for later analysis.
```
python merging_ranges.py > output.txt
```
