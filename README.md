# python-practice
This repository contains simple coding problems and solutions written in Python

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your favourite IDE

## How to run .py file
The most basic and the easy way to run Python scripts is by using the python command.
You need to open a command-line and type the word python followed by the path to your script file, like this:
```
python merging_ranges.py
```
It is useful to save the output in a different file for later analysis.
```
python merging_ranges.py > output.txt
```

## List of problems
### Problem 1: Merging Ranges (Sorting)
Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal.
You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
* Problem statement: [merging_ranges.md](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/merging_ranges.md)
* Sample solution: [merging_ranges.py](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/merging_ranges.py)

### Problem 2: Making Change (Dynamic Programming)
Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...
* Problem statement: [change_making.md](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/change_making.md)
* Sample solution: [change_making.py](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/change_making.py)

### Problem 3: Binary Gap (Iterations)
Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
* Problem statement: [binary_gap.md](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/binary_gap.md)
* Sample solution: [binary_gap.py](https://github.com/juliehub/python-practice/blob/master/binary_gap.py)

### Problem 4: Cyclic Rotation (Arrays)
Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
